# Capstone-1-Account-Pro
#About
This is my Capstone Project 1 Account Project.

##This Project
Trying to get this working was fun but a bit frustrating. It was also fun trying to get this working.

##Issues I came across
Some of the issues I came across were trying to read and write from the transactions.csv file. I had to use the BufferedReader and Writer classes to make this work. As you can see, the number of commits I made I have deleted classes or refactored my classes many times. Another issue I came across was when writing to the CSV, it would erase everything in it, so I created a test file to get around that and test my code there instead of the one that was the most important.

##How I did this project
For me personally, I wanted to separate my code into different classes because I wanted my main to be as short and the only thing people need to see is my main and its classes, my other classes, which are longer under the hood. I will say, however, I did get a little lost at first separating my code. At first, I was going to put everything in the main, but I figured out pretty quickly that it would be hard. Another issue I would come across was putting comments in my code, so if I come across an issue, I can fix it quickly, which helped me immensely. 

##Things I used to build my project
I had to use things like W3Schools to understand classes and how they worked, and import that knowledge into my code. IntelliJ is good at importing libraries into your project as soon as you use them, so that was helpful; however, I did learn that you can use import java.io.*; import java.util.*; to import all your library needs, because these take all the libraries and use them together instead of importing lines of code, making it longer. I also used some Stackoverflow to see how debit and credit worked in classes when reading from a file.
